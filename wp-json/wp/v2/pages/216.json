Jet Plumbing &amp; Drain Services installs Bradford White Commercial Water Heaters in apartments, restaurants and other businesses throughout Northern Nevada.<\/p>\n<p>Jet Plumbing may also install and repair other brand water heaters. Jet Plumbing may use Lochinvar brand water heaters and boilers as well as other national brands.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][\/vc_section][vc_section el_class=&#8221;col-md-12&#8243;][vc_row el_class=&#8221;col-md-10 col-md-offset-1&#8243;][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row el_class=&#8221;col-md-10 col-md-offset-1&#8243;][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]\n<h4>Tankless Water Heaters<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Efficient, Yes. Economical, Not Necessarily!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First let us say that Jet Plumbing installs tankless water heaters quite often and when installed in the proper application they are well liked and economical. However, we would like to share some important information that may help you make a decision that on whether one is right for you and your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Up to 30 percent of the average home\u2019s energy budget is spent on heating water. So the question is will switching to a gas-fired tankless water heater cut your energy costs in half like their manufacturer\u2019s claim? Possibly! Does that mean it\u2019s time to switch? Again, possibly.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike tank type water heaters that hold and reheat water for use when needed, gas tankless water heaters work by running water through a heat exchanger which uses high powered burners to rapidly heat the water only when there is a demand for hot water. And although this application can be up to 22 percent more efficient than the average tank type water heater, the initial cost to install them, upgrade the venting and gas service line may take you up to 20+ years or longer to break even. And that\u2019s if the tankless water heater lasts 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>Before we continue we would also like to mention that there are electric tankless water heaters in production. However tests have found that many can\u2019t produce hot water fast enough or consistently in areas that have cold groundwater. And in areas where the incoming water is warmer, having to upgrade their home\u2019s electrical service to accommodate the usage is not economical. The information in this article focuses on natural gas units and their operation.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-responsive center-block\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/tankless-water-heater-repair-replacement-jet-plumbing.jpg\" alt=\"rinnai\" \/>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][\/vc_section][vc_section el_class=&#8221;col-md-12 pad-b2&#8243;][vc_row el_class=&#8221;col-md-10 col-md-offset-1&#8243;][vc_column][vc_tta_accordion style=&#8221;modern&#8221; color=&#8221;white&#8221; active_section=&#8221;1&#8243;][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;Water runs hot and cold&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;1568826732452-0b163a70-6b41&#8243;][vc_column_text]Manufacturers advertise the biggest benefit of their products is to provide endless hot water. But among those polled the complaint of inconsistent water temperatures was fairly common. When you turn on the faucet, tankless models feed in some cold water to gauge how big a temperature rise is needed. If there is standing cold water in a line that is drawn between old and new hot water, this may cause what\u2019s referred to as a \u201ccold water sandwich\u201d which can be very unappealing while bathing.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;Water may not get hot when using a small volume&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;1568826732480-2064dabe-c668&#8243;][vc_column_text]When performing tasks like shaving, the demand for a small amount of hot water may not be enough to ignite the unit\u2019s burner.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;Up-front costs are high&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;1568826835822-75e073d9-1802&#8243;][vc_column_text]Tankless water heaters cost $825 to $1,200 compared with $350 to $550 for the regular storage-tank types not including installation and code upgrades if any. Tankless water heater models also need electrical outlets for their fan and electronics which may add to the cost if you are replacing a tank type water heater.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;Tankless units might need more care&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;1568826876811-bd037459-3ef3&#8243;][vc_column_text]Regularly scheduled maintenance is important to keeping your tankless water heater operation properly. Build up from calcium and magnesium will cause a decrease in efficiency and restrict flow through the unit. And depending on the quality of the water in your area, many manufactures and industry professionals recommend that tankless models be serviced once a year by a qualified technician. This involves flushing the unit with vinegar and cleaning the burners. [\/vc_column_text][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=&#8221;Efficient storage model prices raised&#8221; tab_id=&#8221;1568826907224-ecfb0713-0634&#8243;][vc_column_text]As of April, 2015 new regulations set forth by the US Department of Energy have caused water heater manufactures change the way their water heater operate to meet higher efficiency standards. And these changes have caused the costs of tank type water heaters to increase. However there is still a fairly broad cost different between the installation costs of a tankless water heater and a tank type unit.<\/p>\n<p>Jet Plumbing, Heating &amp; Drain Services would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your needs is respect to tank type and tankless water heaters or any other plumbing repairs.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_tta_section][\/vc_tta_accordion][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][\/vc_section][vc_section el_class=&#8221;col-md-12&#8243;][vc_row el_class=&#8221;col-md-10 col-md-offset-1&#8243;][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]\n<h3 class=\"sub\">Water Heaters Brands<\/h3>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;pad-t3 pad-b3&#8243;]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rinnai.us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-responsive center-block icon-fade affiliate-height\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Rinnai-tankless-water-heater-jet-plumbing-plumber-300x107.png\" alt=\"rinnai\" \/><\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;pad-t3 pad-b3&#8243;]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lochinvar.com\/products\/default.aspx?type=category&amp;categoryid=12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-responsive center-block icon-fade affiliate-height\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Lochinvar_boiler-jet-plumber-heater-repair.png\" alt=\"lochinavar boiler\" \/><\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;pad-t3 pad-b3&#8243;]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slantfin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-responsive center-block icon-fade affiliate-height\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/slant-fin-boiler-Jet-Plumbing-Plumber-heat.png\" alt=\"slant fin boiler\" \/><\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.crownboiler.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-responsive center-block icon-fade affiliate-height\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/crown-boiler-heater-Jet-Plumbing-Plumber-300x244.png\" alt=\"crown boiler\" \/><\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][\/vc_section][vc_section][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;text-center pad-t5 pad-b5&#8243;]\n<h3 class=\"sub\">Having water heater issues?
