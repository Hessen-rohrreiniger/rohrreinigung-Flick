This device, known as a reduced pressure backflow preventer or RPBP, is an important safety device designed to prevent the possibility of contaminated water from back feeding to the municipal water system, should there be a drop in pressure through the line. In water supply systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.<\/p>\n<p>By law these devices have to be tested annually by certified &amp; licensed personnel and Jet Plumbing can perform this test, usually within 48 hours. And if the initial test fails, Jet Plumbing\u2019s technicians are also qualified to make repairs and retest the system. Not every licensed tester is able to do that which could save time and money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Call Jet Plumbing today at 331-3933 or simply fax your Truckee Meadows Water Authority \u201cBackflow Prevention Compliance Notification\u201d sheet to 331-5584.
